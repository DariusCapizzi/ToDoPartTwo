# Darius's To-Do

## Description

New things. One favor, two ideas.

## Setup

1. Read the list.
2. Think.
3. Do the things you wanna do, man.

## List

1. **One favor:** I'm helping organize a conference August 6-7 for web designers
and developers here in Portland, [Devsigner](https://www.devsignercon.com/). I'm
the speaker coordinator, and I'd love to invite Epicodus students to submit
session proposals. Link is on the home page; deadline is Friday July 22. Do you
think you could let people know? I can give you an email to forward or a flyer
if that's easier. They do not need to have any experience speaking. (And also,
if people don't want to speak, I also hope they'll consider attending!)

2. **One idea:** Want to speak at Devsigner? You've taught at FreeGeek so you
have experience. We have a deep need for introductory sessions, and they're only
45 minutes long. You could present any number of things you learned in Epicodus.
You could also do a hands-on workshop that would be similar to the FreeGeek
classes you taught. I totally believe in you and would love to have you present.
And also if you want help, I'd be happy to support you as a co-presenter (even
if I'm not an expert on whatever you choose to present on). What do you think?

3. **Second idea:** Come hang out! I know, you don't have a lot of free time.
Don't feel pressured. But we like hanging out with you, and Tuesday too.

## Technologies Used
